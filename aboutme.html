        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I was born in Hershey, Pennsylvania on the 28th of January, 2000. I grew up in the small
            and rather unknown town of Quarryville, near the southern end of Pennsylviana, in Lancaster county.
            I first touched a computer at around the age of 6 or 7, and have been interested in them ever since then. My interests have been varied over my life, and will continue
            to change in the many years forward.
